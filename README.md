This repository showcases a common error in TypeScript when comparing objects: using JSON.stringify for deep comparison.  The `bug.ts` file contains the erroneous code, which incorrectly uses JSON.stringify to determine object equality. This leads to false negatives in certain cases, such as when objects have different property orders or contain non-serializable data types.  The `bugSolution.ts` file demonstrates a more robust approach using a recursive comparison function, resolving the limitations of JSON.stringify.
